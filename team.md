# Team

## Sébastien Arnaud

core.nlp was initially created by
[Sébastien Arnaud](http://arnaudsj.me/) as a Clojure abstraction to many
great Java NLP libraries such as [Standford CoreNLP](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml), [OpenNLP](https://opennlp.apache.org/) and
[LingPipe](http://alias-i.com/lingpipe/) in order to effortlessly unify NLP implementations in Clojure.

Sébastien is a software architect, engineer, and inventor. Entrepreneur at
heart with a passion for data sciences, in particular machine learning, GGP,
NLP and text analytics.

## All the others

The core.nlp team tries to live an open development model, embracing
contribution by others.
