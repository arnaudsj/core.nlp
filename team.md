## Sébastien Arnaud

core.nlp was initially created by
[Sébastien Arnaud](http://arnaudsj.me/) as a Clojure abstraction to many
great Java NLP libraries such as [Standford CoreNLP](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml), [OpenNLP](https://opennlp.apache.org/) and
[LingPipe](http://alias-i.com/lingpipe/) in order to effortlessly unify NLP implementations in Clojure.

Sébastien is a French Software Architect, Engineer, and Inventor. With a passion for Data Science, in particular Machine Learning, General Game playing, Natural Language Processing and Text Analytics, Sébastien is an entrepreneur, who loves turning ideas into products.
Sébastien joined [Opinionlab](http://www.opinionlab.com/), in 2001 and lead the technology innovation, operation and development of the company for almost a decade before focusing of research and development endeavors in the field of text analytics and machine learning. He is the co-author of two patents: #[US20050240618](http://www.google.com/patents/US20050240618), and #[US20080033790](http://www.google.com/patents/US20080033790) and is always looking for new Voice of Customer (VoC) innovations.
Sébastien joined the [pAPIs.io](http://www.papis.io/) program review committee to help shape this new conference. He is an active open source contributor and polyglot programmer. Most of his public contributions can be found at: [https://github.com/arnaudsj](https://github.com/arnaudsj).

Sébastien obtained the Master level on [Kaggle.com](http://www.kaggle.com/) in 2014 for his past competitive entries, in particular for his real-time competitive solution for the “[Job Salary Prediction](http://www.kaggle.com/c/job-salary-prediction/leaderboard/public)”  using Lucene similarities and Genetic Programing which ranked him in the top 150 machine learning professionals in March 2013.
He has also appeared on several occasions on podcasts such as [Techzing](http://techzinglive.com/) and wrote an AI game engine in Javascript for a novel iPad board game, called “[Swarm](http://swarmsg.com/)”, created by [Justin Vincent](http://justinvincent.com/). At that time, he also contributed early on to the development of the [Titanium](http://www.appcelerator.com/titanium/) mobile platform.

In 1999, Sébastien founded E-Media Library, Inc. an online digital photography platform for Universities, which was used for several years at [Auburn University](http://www.auburn.edu) before freely available solutions such as [Yahoo Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/) and other alternatives took over. Sébastien presented the solution at [Educause](http://www.educause.edu/library/resources/birth-digital-media-library-student-need-institutional-resource) in 2002.
Early in his career, he also worked in the research field for the [European Space Agency](http://www.esa.int/ESA) in Paris, France and [Daewoo Heavy Industry](http://www.dsme.co.kr/epub/main/index.do) in South Korea, on an autonomous submarine for deep sea mapping after graduating from renowned French engineering school [ESIEE](http://www.esiee.fr/), with a Msc. in Computer Science and Microelectronics.

The core.nlp team will thrive to live under an open development model, embracing
contribution by others. Please, do not hesitate to contact me if you are interested to become a permanent contributor or submit pull requests for review.
